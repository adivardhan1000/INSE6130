By providing a specially crafted path argument for the container to build, it is possible to inject command options to the git fetch/git checkout commands that are executed by Docker and to execute code with the privileges of the user running Docker. A local attacker who can run docker build with a controlled build path, or a remote attacker who has control over the docker build path, could elevate their privileges or execute code.", "CVSS": 6.7, "Link": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2019-13139", "Script": "CVE-2019-13139.py"}]
